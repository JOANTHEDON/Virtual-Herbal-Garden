🔮 Project Prompt: Virtual Herbal Garden (SIH1555)
📌 Objective:
Design and develop a Virtual Herbal Garden – an interactive, immersive, and educational web/mobile platform that allows users to explore medicinal plants used in traditional Indian systems of medicine (AYUSH: Ayurveda, Yoga & Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha, Homeopathy) through 3D visualization, detailed data, multimedia, and personalized interaction.

🧠 Problem Statement Summary:
Traditional medicinal plant knowledge is not easily accessible to the common public. Physical herbal gardens are limited by geography. This project aims to bridge the gap by building a digital platform where users can interactively explore medicinal plants, understand their uses, origins, and health benefits, and take guided virtual tours categorized by treatment areas.

🚀 Features to Implement:
🌿 1. Plant Library
Browse a collection of 50–100 medicinal plants.

Each plant card includes:

Botanical name & common name

Habitat & region

Medicinal uses (e.g., skin care, immunity)

Cultivation method

🔍 2. Search & Filter
Search by name, benefit, region, or category (e.g., immunity boosters, digestion).

Apply filters to sort plants based on symptoms or health focus.

🧩 3. 3D/AR Interaction (Optional but Impressive)
Display 3D models of herbs using Unity, WebGL, or libraries like Three.js.

Rotate, zoom, and inspect plants interactively.

Optionally integrate AR for mobile view.

🎥 4. Multimedia Support
High-quality images

Embedded videos or YouTube links explaining plant preparation or usage

Optional: Audio narration of each plant description (text-to-speech)

📝 5. User Interaction
Bookmark/favorite a plant

Add personal notes

Share plant info on WhatsApp/social media

🧭 6. Virtual Tour Mode
Curated paths like:

“Top 10 Immunity Herbs”

“Skin Healing Plants”

“Digestive Aids Tour”

Include guided descriptions, images, and narration.

💡 Expected Outcome:
A fully functional Virtual Herbal Garden that is:

Informative for students & enthusiasts
