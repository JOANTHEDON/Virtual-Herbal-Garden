Prompt:

I am building a project called Virtual Herbal Garden. I need you to fix and improve the current version with the following changes:

🔁 General Improvements:
Make all buttons functional – Currently, only a few buttons are working. Ensure all buttons (like "Explore", "More Info", "Favorites", etc.) lead to proper pages or modals.

Add a "Back" button on every sub-page (like Plant Detail, AR Viewer, etc.) to return to the main plant list or previous section.

🌿 Plant Detail Page:
When a user clicks on a plant card:

Show detailed information about the plant (botanical name, uses, region, cultivation, etc.)

Use a preview section to display the 3D model of the plant

🧊 3D Model Integration:
Instead of default 3D models or links, use my own 3D model files (e.g., .glb, .gltf, or .obj) that are uploaded in the public/models/ folder or hosted externally.

Use Three.js or any supported viewer to render these models inside the plant detail section.

Ensure the 3D viewer supports zoom, rotate, and pan interaction.

Example file path:
public/models/tulsi_model.glb → should load when user clicks on Tulsi.

🤖 Chatbot Fix:
The chatbot is currently non-functional. Fix it so that:

It answers basic questions like “What are the benefits of neem?”, “Show me plants for immunity”, “How to grow tulsi?”

You can use a simple rule-based model or integrate with OpenAI/Gemini if possible.

Place the chatbot icon on the bottom-right and open it in a chat-style modal.

Keep a default message or guide like “Ask me about any herbal plant!”

📱 UI & Responsiveness:
Make sure the entire web app is mobile-friendly (responsive design using CSS Flexbox or Grid).

The 3D viewer and details section should adapt well on mobile screens.

Bonus (optional if time):

Add bookmarking/favorite feature per plant using LocalStorage or a temporary in-memory array.

Include search/filter bar for plant categories (like digestion, immunity, etc.).
